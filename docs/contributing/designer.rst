Hello, designer. Welcome to the Mautic Community!

.. vale on

Thank you for considering contributing to Mautic. Currently, there aren’t many designers actively contributing to Mautic, so this is a great opportunity for you to make a big difference.

As a designer, you can contribute in various ways, depending on your interests and how you can apply your skills to current projects.

Some areas you may want to consider:

.. vale off

- Supporting the Product Team by creating visual resources to explain new features and improving the user experience of Mautic
- Helping the Marketing Team with designing their monthly newsletters
- Creating new designs for Mautic's web resources (for example, the :xref:`Mautic website`)
- Contributing to Strategic Initiatives by designing the user experience for new features
- Improving the user documentation by creating illustrations or images that complement the written information
- Building a pattern library to standardize the UI patterns used in Mautic
- Joining the User Experience Tiger Team

Getting started as a designer
*****************************

The first step for you is to join :xref:`Mautic Community Slack`.

Design tasks are primarily cross-project rather than specific to a team. You're most welcome to join whatever channels that interest you.

However, one recommendation is to join the :xref:`Mautic design team Slack` channel on Slack to see requests for design-related tasks. Introduce yourself in the channel and share how you want to get involved. If you're unsure how to participate, don't worry—support is available to help you find your way.

Finding a design task
=====================

You can browse the :xref:`Mautic low- and no-code projects board` to find tasks or issues that match your skills and availability.

The board uses a layout, where each card represents a task and includes:

- **Description:** what the task is about
- **Status:** status of the task, such as 'Ready', 'In Progress', or 'Done'
- **Priority:** how urgent or important the task is
- **Size:** an estimate of the effort required

If you've identified a task you'd like to work on, leave a comment on the task or issue so that a team member can assign it to you.

If you need help, please reach out to the team. When you start working on a task, let others know in the Slack channel.

.. tip::

   All Mautic Slack team channels use the prefix ``#t-``, initiatives use ``#i-``, tiger teams use ``#tt-``, and working groups use ``#wg-``.

GitHub issues and pull requests
===============================

Another way to find tasks related to user experience or user interface—also known as UX/UI—in the Mautic product is to review the GitHub issue queue and pull requests.

- Search the GitHub issue queue for :xref:`Mautic UX issues` or :xref:`Mautic UI issues` issues
- Search GitHub pull requests to find new features and bug fixes to test relating to :xref:`Mautic UX pull requests` or :xref:`Mautic UI pull requests` improvements

Issues are problems or bugs that Mautic users and developers have reported when they encountered them. Pull requests are change proposals that include bug fixes or new features that require review. If approved, the team will release them in a future version of Mautic.

If you can provide feedback on issues or pull requests, please leave a comment. If you’d like to test the pull request and share your thoughts from a design perspective, click the ‘Files changed’ tab, then the green ‘Review changes’ button. That way, you can approve, request changes, or leave a comment after reviewing.

General principles to follow
****************************

Whenever you design for the Mautic Community, you must share the source files in the :xref:`Mautic Google Drive`.

Any images you use must have the appropriate copyright permissions, and you should share them with the team lead so that they have a copy of the licenses.

When working on web-based tools, please use a personal account whenever possible. This will ensure that your work remains accessible if you change jobs. Additionally, share full access to your account with the relevant team lead so they can interact with the resources as needed. Ask the team lead if there is a community account or team to which they can add you before you start working with a specific tool.

Reporting problems with design
******************************

Positive, constructive feedback on a design is always welcome. It’s even better if it includes a proposal for fixing the issue.

Within the Mautic product
=========================

.. vale on

If you notice something that needs attention in Mautic, please:

1. Create :xref:`GitHub create an issue` and provide as much detail as possible
2. Indicate this in the issue if you can address the problem. You can always ask for help with how to do this if needed.
3. Leave a hint in the issue if you can't address the bug but know where it probably comes from. Doing so helps people follow up and get a jump start.

.. vale off

Outside of the Mautic product
=============================

.. vale on

Please first report the issue in the relevant Slack channel for the team responsible for the defect you have spotted. They'll then be able to direct you on how best to proceed with reporting the issue and having it addressed.
