## Reporting a Bug

If you think you've found a bug, please let us know. This helps us build a better Mautic for everyone.

>>>> If you think that you have found a security vulnerability, please submit it via the [documented process][security-issue] with as much detail as possible. The core team will review the vulnerability and if found applicable, will create the patch in a private repository. The vulnerability will be disclosed once the patch has been included into a release.  You can read more about our security processes [here][security-team].

Before submitting a bug:
- Double-check that nothing is wrong with your local installation, like permission issues, outdated cache, etc. - please read the [Troubleshooting][troubleshooting] guide!
- If you're not sure whether the issue is really a bug, please ask for help in the [Mautic Community Forums][forums] first.

If you're quite sure that the issue is a bug, please [report it][report-bugs] in our GitHub repository and provide us with as many details as possible (reproduction steps, Mautic/PHP versions, etc.). The more details we have, the easier it is for us to try and troubleshoot your issue.

## Fixing a bug

If you're able to fix a bug - whether it's one you found, or something reported by someone else in the community - please make a [pull request][pull-request]. Be sure to link the pull request to any issues that it resolves by including in your description 'fixes #issuenumber'.

Providing test instructions is extremely important - please do not assume the person testing your pull request will be a developer. Provide clear, step-by-step instructions of how to reproduce the bug, and then how to check that your pull request fixes it.
