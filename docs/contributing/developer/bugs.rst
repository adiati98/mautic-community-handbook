Reporting a bug
***************

Before submitting a bug:

* Make sure there are no problems with your local installation, such as permission problems, outdated cache, etc. Please refer to Mautic's :xref:`Mautic troubleshooting` guide for assistance.
* If you're unsure whether the problem is a bug, please ask for help first in the :xref:`Mautic Community Forums`.

When you are confident that the problem is a bug, please create a new :xref:`Create a new issue for Mautic` in the repository and provide as many details as possible, such as reproduction steps, Mautic/PHP versions, etc.

Providing step-by-step instructions for reproducing a bug is extremely important because the person who triages your issue might not be a developer.
