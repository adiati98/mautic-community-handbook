Every new feature and bug fix released in Mautic undergoes testing and code review by community members before it's included in a release.

Mautic is always looking out for people to help with these processes. Even if you can spare an hour or two a week, it significantly increases the number of bugs and features that reach the hands of Mautic users.

Mautic maintains :xref:`Mautic OSS Fridays board`, which shows you a list of all of the bugs and features that need to get tested.

There are two ways to set up your testing environment:

1. On GitHub Codespaces
2. On your local machine with DDEV—**recommended**

Once your testing environment is established, it's very quick and easy to test bugs and features.

.. tip::

  You can watch the short tutorial about :xref:`How to test bugs and features in Mautic` on YouTube, which explains the easy way to do it.

Setting up a testing environment on GitHub Codespaces
*****************************************************

:xref:`GitHub Codespaces` allows you to spin up a Mautic instance in the cloud, with a pull request—also known as PR—applied. The Mautic instance also has a mail catching tool, Mailpit, and PHPMyAdmin available to view database tables. While some PRs can't be tested in this way, such as when testing the installation process, the vast majority can.

Setting up a codespace
======================

#. Go to :xref:`Mautic GitHub repository`.
#. Open the PR that you need to test.
#. Click the 'Code' button on the right top, next to the PR title.
#. Click the 'Codespaces' tab.
#. Click the green 'Create codespace on ``BRANCH-NAME``' or '+' sign to create a codespace.

   .. image:: images/open_codespace_github.png
    :alt: Screenshot highlighting Code button and Codespaces tab

#. Wait until the codespace finishes building and the ``postCreateCommand`` finishes its task, as shown in the screenshot below. Please be patient, as it may take some time.

   .. image:: images/postcreatecommand_task_done.png
    :alt: Screenshot of postCreateCommand task is done

   **Note:** If you get a warning that the codespace is currently running in recovery mode due to a configuration error, as in the following screenshot, follow the instructions in the :ref:`Rebuild a codespace` section.

   .. image:: images/codespace_recovery_mode_warning.png
    :alt: Warning message that says this codespace is currently running in recovery mode due to a container error.
    :scale: 80 %
    :align: center

#. Once the ``postCreateCommand`` is done, run ``ddev start`` to install Mautic and its dependencies.
#. Type 'Y' and press Enter when you get prompted to ``Permission to beam up? [Y/n] (yes):``.

   Please wait until the process is complete, which may take a few minutes to complete.

#. Click the 'Ports' tab.
#. Find the port that you need to open.
#. Hover over the 'Forwarded Address' tab, right next to the port.
#. Click the globe icon to open the port in the browser.

   .. image:: images/vscode_terminal_ports_tab.png
    :alt: Screenshot of ports tab in VS Code terminal, highlighting globe icon 

#. Log in to Mautic. See the tip below to log in to Mautic.

After you set up the environment, you can follow the test instructions in the PR and :ref:`report back your findings<Leaving a PR review>`.

.. tip::

   * The default username to login to Mautic is always ``admin``, and the password is ``Maut1cR0cks!``.
   * If you're testing an older version of Mautic than ``5.1``, use the password ``mautic``.
   * You can run the ``ddev describe`` command to see the list and details of available URLs and ports.

Rebuild a codespace
-------------------

Follow these steps to rebuild your codespace:

#. Press ``Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P``. It opens a search bar on top.
#. Search for 'Codespaces: Rebuild Container', select it, and click it.

   .. image:: images/codespaces_rebuild_container.png
    :alt: Screenshot of Codespaces rebuild container selection

#. Click the 'Full Rebuild' button.

   .. image:: images/codespaces_rebuild_button.png
    :alt: Screenshot highlighting the full rebuild button on Codespaces
    :align: center
    :scale: 70 %

#. Follow the instructions starting from step 6 in the :ref:`Setting up a codespace` section.

.. note::

   Now that you've set up the codespace, go to the :ref:`Testing your first PR` section to start testing a PR. 

Setting up a local testing environment
**************************************

Prerequisites
=============

Before starting, you need a few pieces of software on your computer:

* A Docker provider \*
* :xref:`DDEV get started`
* :xref:`Git downloads`
* :xref:`GitHub CLI`

\* Please read the :xref:`Docker installation` section on the DDEV official website to learn which Docker provider is suitable for your operating system.

Once you have these installed, use a code editor such as :xref:`VS Code`, which allows you to interact with files, folders, and the command line. There are other editors and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). So if you already have a preference, by all means, use that.

You also need to register for an account at :xref:`GitHub signup` if you don't already have one. It allows you to leave comments when you've tested things, and also means you can make fixes yourself in the future.

Forking the repository
======================

Forking the repository is the first step you need to take before proceeding. Forking means making a copy of a repository to your GitHub account.

To fork the repository:

#. Go to :xref:`Mautic GitHub repository`.
#. Click the 'Fork' button at the top.

   .. image:: images/fork_button_github.png
    :alt: Screenshot highlighting the fork button on GitHub

#. Choose your username in the 'Owner \*' dropdown menu. **Don't select an organization here. Always choose your personal account**.

   .. image:: images/owner_dropdown_menu_github.png
    :alt: Screenshot highlighting the choose fork owner dropdown menu on GitHub
    :scale: 50 %
    :align: center

#. Uncheck the checkbox of 'Copy the ``DEFAULT-BRANCH-NAME`` branch only' because later on, you want to be able to clone multiple branches.
#. Click the green 'Create fork' button at the bottom.

   .. image:: images/uncheck_option_and_create_fork_button_github.png
    :alt: Screenshot of an unchecked state checkbox to copy only the default branch and a create fork button on GitHub

Cloning the repository
======================

After you forked the repository, you need to clone it. Cloning means making a copy of a repository in your local environment. In this case, you want to clone your forked repository.

The :xref:`Mautic GitHub repository` contains multiple branches that represent specific release versions of Mautic. You should clone the branch that you need to test into its own dedicated folder.

For example, when you need to test Mautic versions 6 and 7, clone the branch ``6.0`` and save it in a folder. Then, clone the branch ``7.x`` and save it in a separate folder. You can name the folder anything you want, but it's best to reflect the branch name. For example, use names like ``mautic6``, ``mautic7``, and so on.

Follow the steps below to clone your forked repository:

#. Create a folder in your local computer where you'll locate all your local working environments. It's up to you what to name it and where you save it.
#. Inside the newly created folder, create another folder and name it ``mautic``.
#. Open your editor, and within the editor, open a terminal window.  
#. In the terminal, move into the directory you just created. Use the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd YOUR-FOLDER/mautic

   If you're unsure where you are, run the following command to see the list of the directories and files of the current folder that you're at:

   .. code-block:: bash

      ls

   If you need to move up a directory, for example, back to ``/YOUR-FOLDER/``, you can use the command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd ..

#. Run the ``git clone`` command specifying the branch you need to test and a folder name to save it, then hit Enter:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone --branch BRANCH-NAME https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/mautic FOLDER-NAME

   Here are some examples:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone --branch 5.2 https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/mautic.git mautic5
      git clone --branch 6.0 https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/mautic.git mautic6
      git clone --branch 7.x https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/mautic.git mautic7

.. note::

   DDEV uses the folder name as the project name, so later on, this automatically gives you clean URLs like:

   * ``https://mautic5.ddev.site``
   * ``https://mautic6.ddev.site``
   * ``https://mautic7.ddev.site``

Setting up a local DDEV instance
================================

Now that you have the repository's branch that you need to test locally, it's time to set up a local DDEV instance so you can use PHP, MySQL, and all the other components that Mautic requires to run.

#. Move into the directory using the command, where 'X' is the version of Mautic that you saved in your ``mautic`` folder:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd mauticX

   For example:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd mautic7

#. Start the DDEV environment with this command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      ddev start

   The first time you run this command, it might take a little while to run through the process.

#. If prompted to install Mautic, choose 'Yes'.

   This installs all the dependencies that Mautic requires to run.

Live preview the Mautic instance
================================
   
Once the installation process finishes, it displays the URL for the Mautic instance, as well as the URLs for Mailpit and PHPMyAdmin, in case you need to test outgoing emails or database operations. It also provides you with the default credentials to use for the login.

.. image:: images/ddev_information_after_built.png
    :alt: Screenshot of information to run DDEV that highlights Mautic login credentials and live preview URLs

Follow the steps below to open the Mautic instance:

#. Hover over the link to the URL of the Mautic instance.
#. Open the link in the browser by pressing ``Alt + click``.
#. Log in to Mautic. See the tip below to log in to Mautic.

.. tip::

   * The default username to login to Mautic is always ``admin``, and the password is ``Maut1cR0cks!``.
   * If you're testing an older version of Mautic than ``5.1``, use the password ``mautic``.

Testing your first PR
*********************

The first step when testing a bug is to attempt to reproduce the bug and ensure that you are experiencing the same problem that the developer is trying to fix. Please read the :ref:`Reproducing a bug` section for the complete steps.

Generally, instructions are included in the PR description, but you may need to refer to an issue that reports the bug to find instructions for reproducing the problem. If you don't understand or are unable to reproduce the issue, please leave a comment, and the developer would respond with further instructions.

Once you have confirmed the bug, you can start testing the PR:

#. Ensure you reproduce the bug using the base branch that the PR was made against. It should target the branch of the Mautic release version that's reported on the issue. You can see the base branch right under the PR title.

   .. image:: images/pr_base_branch_github.png
    :alt: Screenshot highlighting a PR base branch at GitHub

#. In the terminal, run the GitHub CLI command below:

   .. code-block:: bash

      gh pr checkout NUMBER

   Replace ``NUMBER`` with the ID number of the PR. You can find this next to the PR title.

   This command pulls down the changes made by the developer and applies them to your local Mautic instance. It also clears your cache automatically.

Now that you have the PR in your environment, the next step is to retest the bug or check out the new feature. Make sure you are thorough in your testing. Really think about every possible thing that might be affected by the changes being made in the PR, and test it in detail.

It would be very helpful if you could :ref:`write a comment<Leaving a PR review>` explaining what you have tested.

Reproducing a bug
=================

First, you need to update the base branch in your forked repository:

#. Go to your forked repository: ``https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/mautic``.
#. Click the branch dropdown menu on the top left.
#. Select the branch where you need to reproduce the bug from.

   .. image:: images/switch_branch_dropwdown_menu_github.png
    :alt: Screenshot highlighting the branch dropdown menu on a repository at GitHub
    :scale: 70 %
    :align: center

#. Click the 'Sync fork' button on the top right to ensure that the branch in your forked repository is up to date. 

   If your branch is up to date, it shows "This branch isn't behind the upstream ``mautic/BRANCH-NAME``" message.

   However, if you need to update your branch, click the green 'Update branch' button.

   .. image:: images/sync_fork_update_branch_code_buttons_github.png
    :alt: Screenshot highlighting the sync fork, update branch, and code buttons at GitHub

Then, follow the instructions below, depending on your testing environment.

GitHub Codespaces
-----------------

#. Click the green 'Code' button at the top right.
#. Follow the instructions starting from step 4 in the :ref:`Setting up a codespace` section.

Local environments
------------------

#. Open the branch folder that you need to test in your code editor.
#. Run ``git status`` to ensure you're on the correct branch.

   If you're not on the correct branch, run ``git switch BRANCH-NAME`` to switch the branch.

   Here are some examples:

   .. code-block::

      git switch 5.2
      git switch 6.0
      git switch 7.x

#. Run the following command to fetch new changes from your forked repository:

   .. code-block::

      git pull

Using developer mode
====================

When testing Mautic, it's important that you're notified of any errors rather than having them output to the logs. To avoid the need for constantly rebuilding the JavaScript and CSS files when changes are made, developer mode is used in the Mautic Community. This mode is configured in the local environment file.

DDEV has developer mode enabled by default. Read more about :xref:`Mautic environments docs` on Mautic Developer Documentation.

Testing top tips
================

Installing sample data
----------------------

To quickly install sample data, use the command ``ddev exec bin/console d:f:l`` which loads the Doctrine fixtures. It gives you a big head start with testing.

Build the segments after install
--------------------------------

It's always worth building the segments once you install the sample data, using the command ``ddev exec bin/console m:s:r``.  

Testing with different databases / PHP versions
-----------------------------------------------

In DDEV, you can set the database and PHP version in a file located in the ``.ddev/config.yaml`` folder.

#. :ref:`Set up a GitHub codespace<Setting up a codespace>` from the PR you are testing and immediately stop the build process as soon as the terminal window is displayed by pressing ``Cmd/Ctrl + C`` on your keyboard.

#. Delete anything that has already been started with the command ``ddev delete --omit-snapshot --yes && rm -rf var/cache && rm app/config/local.php``.

#. Edit the file in ``.ddev/config.yaml`` and change the setting—for instance, change DB from MariaDB 10.3 to MySQL 8. Always remember to save the file.

   .. code-block:: yaml

      mariadb_version: ""
      mysql_version: "8.0"

#. Type ``ddev start`` in the terminal to continue with installation.

#. Run the installer in the UI or on the command line, as preferred. All the credentials for the database are ``db``.

#. Check that you're using the right version in the system information within Mautic.

#. Remember to make sure you are :ref:`using developer mode<Using developer mode>`. DDEV should start in developer mode by default, with the Symfony toolbar at the bottom of the page.

#. If you make a mistake, open your :xref:`GitHub Codespaces` dashboard, delete the codespace, and start again.

Resetting your local testing environment
----------------------------------------

To quickly reset your local testing environment by deleting the DDEV containers without a database snapshot, removing the cache directory, and removing the ``local.php`` file, you can run this command:

.. code-block::
   
   ddev delete --omit-snapshot --yes && rm -rf var/cache && rm app/config/local.php

Leaving a PR review
*******************

Within GitHub, there is a built-in system that allows users to leave reviews:

#. Click the 'Files changed' tab, under the PR title.
#. Click the green 'Review changes' button at the top right, which allows you to start a review.

.. image:: images/pr_review_github.png
    :alt: Screenshot of a PR review page at GitHub, highlighting the files changed and review changes buttons

From this point, you can share what you have found when testing the PR. You can select whether you:

* approve the PR,
* need to ask for some changes, for instance, if you weren't able to get the results that you expected,
* leave a comment if you're not sure either way,
* want to leave some feedback.

Unloading the PR
****************

Once you have finished testing the PR, it's good practice to revert to the original state. To do this, use the command:

.. code-block:: bash

   git checkout BASE-BRANCH-NAME

The ``BASE-BRANCH-NAME`` is the branch that you want to return to. This command checks you out from the PR to the base branch, where you started from.

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   git checkout 5.2
   git checkout 6.0
   git checkout 7.x

Now you're ready to go and find another PR to test. Have a little celebration because you helped make Mautic even more awesome. Thank you for your contribution.
