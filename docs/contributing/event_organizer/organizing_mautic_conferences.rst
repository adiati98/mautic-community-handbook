Organising Mautic conferences
#############################

Here is an explanation of the roles that we have available if you would like to get involved in organising the online or in-person official Mautic Conference events in the Mautic Community.

All roles will require you to work well with others, as our team is distributed around the world.  Time commitments are estimates based on experiences of running previous events.

Note that this would be a best case scenario of having a larger team with people taking on smaller amounts of responsibility. In reality, it might end up that the lead takes on some of the contributor roles, if there are not enough volunteers. We should (in my opinion) try as hard as we can to build out these teams rather than have lots of work fall on a small number of shoulders.

Generally speaking, the team meets once a week for a 1 hour meeting on a Monday, this has been included in the estimates.

.. note::

   If you're interested in contributing to one of these teams, please first join the ``#mauticon`` channel on :xref:`Mautic Community Slack` and let us know what team you're interested in joining and which role you would like to be considered for.

Online conferences
******************

Mautic Conference Global events are always held virtually. This allows us to involve the widest possible audience and reach our truly global community.

Leads and contributors will have their tickets covered by the event.

In-person conferences
*********************

An in-person conference has quite different requirements and timescales when compared with an online event.  Most importantly, the leaders in the team must be able to physically travel to the location of the event and be in attendance for the duration of the event.

Most events will be held over two days, and will be multi-track.

Leads will have their ticket, travel and accommodation covered by the event. Contributors will have their ticket covered by the event.
